# Calculator6
Simple calculator. 
Android development mid course project.
Screen 1 - main calculator.
Screen 2 - history screen.
Screen 3 - about screen.


TODO:
1. Need to take care of runtime changes (i.e. screen orientation change). Currently not well supported due to coding style. Need to put most of the code in onCreate instead of onClick.
2. Advanced features.
